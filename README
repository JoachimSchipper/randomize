This is a fairly simple utility to output stuff in random order. This is useful
if you want to add a random signature to your messages, or want to play music
in a random order ("shuffle"), or...

It's pretty trivial to do this as a one-line perl script, but randomize has
several advantages:
- it's much more efficient for large files or if you only want a few records;
- the input is delimited on newlines by default, but any Perl-compatible
  regular expression may be used (in particular, you can process filenames
  containing spaces and newlines with find -print0 | randomize -e '\0').

This software requires PCRE (the Perl-compatible regular expression library)
and should run on any POSIX-compatible system.

Tweak the DEFINES variable in the Makefile if your system does not have
arc4random_uniform(), srandomdev(), SIGINFO or vis(). *BSD/Mac OS X should have
all of these features; Linux only has SIGINFO.
Set the MANDOC variable in the Makefile to groff -mandoc if your system does
not have mandoc.

randomize is available under OpenBSD's version of the ISC license (effectively
the 2-clause BSD license), found in the source files.
